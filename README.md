# Next.js Gemini App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using any package manager of your choice:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following line with your Gemini API key:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

> ⚠️ **Do not commit** your `.env` file to version control. It should be listed in `.gitignore` to protect sensitive information.

### 3. Run the Development Server

Start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can begin editing the app by modifying the `app/page.tsx` file. The page auto-updates as you make changes.
